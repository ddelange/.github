Hi there,

Thank you for opening an issue. Please note that we try to keep the Pelias issue tracker reserved for bug reports and feature requests. For general usage questions, please use the community chat room https://gitter.im/pelias/pelias.

If your issue relates to a specific Pelias sub-project, please open it in the project's own repository. The index of sub-projects is at https://github.com/pelias

Time spent by members of our community answering your issue is unpaid.
Please be professional and kind to those responding to you.

Bug reports which are clearly written are more likely to get the attention of the developers who can help you.

### Use-cases
<!--
In order to properly evaluate a feature request, it is necessary to understand the use-cases for it.

Please describe the _end goal_ you are trying to achieve that has led you to request this feature.

Please keep this section focused on the problem and not on the suggested solution. We'll get to that in a moment, below!
-->

### Attempted Solutions
<!---
If you've already tried to solve the problem within Pelias's existing features and found a limitation that prevented you from succeeding, please describe it below in as much detail as possible.

Ideally, this would include real configuration snippets that you tried, real Pelias command lines you ran, and what results you got in each case.

### Proposal
<!---
If you have an idea for a way to address the problem via a change to Pelias features, please describe it below.

In this section, it's helpful to include specific examples of how what you are suggesting might look in configuration files, or on the command line, since that allows us to understand the full picture of what you are proposing.

If you're not sure of some details, don't worry! When we evaluate the feature request we may suggest modifications as necessary to work within the design constraints of Pelias Core.
